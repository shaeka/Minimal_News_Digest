# Minimal News Digest ‚Äî Multi-Agent System

## üìå Overview

This project implements a **Minimal News Digest** system using a **multi-agent AI architecture** built with **LangGraph** and **GPT-4o-mini**.  

The goal is to simulate how multiple specialized AI agents can collaborate to solve a real-world task:  
**automatically fetching news, clustering articles into trends, summarizing them, and compiling a digest.**

### üéØ What the system does
- **Fetcher Agent**  
  - Retrieves news articles (via Tavily search API).  
  - Groups them into **trends** using **embedding-based clustering**.  

- **Summarizer Agent**  
  - Summarizes each article into a few sentences.  
  - Extracts highlights and assesses possible bias.  

- **Editor Agent**  
  - Formats the final output (Markdown, HTML, or plain text).  
  - Organizes the digest by trends, highlights, and full summaries.  

### üß† Key Features
- **Multi-agent pipeline** (Fetcher ‚Üí Summarizer ‚Üí Editor).  
- **Multiple tools per agent** with explicit access control.  
- **Embedding-based clustering** (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` + KMeans) for trend detection.  
- **Shared + agent state management** so information flows between agents.  
- **Mock LLM fallback** ‚Üí works even if no `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (generates placeholder summaries).  
- **One-day build scope**: deterministic and reliable for demonstration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12**  
- Project uses the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.  

### 2. Install dependencies
If you‚Äôre using **uv** (recommended):  

```bash
uv sync
```

If you prefer **pip**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:
```shell
openai
langgraph
python-dotenv
pydantic
langchain_community
scikit-learn
numpy
```

### 3. Configure API Key:
This project requires the following keys to be placed in a `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="enter your key"
TAVILY_API_KEY="enter your key"
DEBUG=true
```

You can get these keys from: 
1. `OPENAI API KEY` from `https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys`
2. `TAVILY_API_KEY` from `https://app.tavily.com/home`

### 4. Run the system
```bash
python main.py "latest news on Agentic AI"
```

#### Command-line options
- topic (default: "AI in healthcare") ‚Üí What topic to fetch news on.
- --style (markdown | html | text) ‚Üí Output format of digest.
- --tone (concise | neutral | friendly | formal) ‚Üí Writing style of summaries.

Example:
```bash
python news_digest_agents.py "latest news on Agentic AI" --style=html --tone=friendly
```

### Sample output:
```markdown
